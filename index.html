		<h1>About me, Jake</h1>
			

		<p>Hello, my name is Jake.</p>

		<h2><strong>My disease</strong></h2> 

		<p> Around age 8 and 9 I got this thing called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/henoch-schonlein-purpura/symptoms-causes/syc-20354040"><strong>HSP</strong></a>. It was a very rare disorder. I would get these big red welts over my skin. I also had a chance to lose my kidneys if I didn't drink enough water. By the age of 10 I successfully got over it, it was really hard because I had to take a lot of medication and I wouldn't be able to play sports a lot. It was a very hard time for me and my family, but I was so happy once I got over it.</p>

		<h2>Hobbies</h2> 

		<p>I have a lot of hobbies, I really love sports and video games. Some video games I like are, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/home"> fortnite</a>, <a href="https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/home/index.aspx">rainbow six siege</a>, <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/">overwatch</a> , and <strong>many</strong> more games. I think video games are really fun because they can be a break from all the stressful stuff. Its a time to have fun in a different world. Even though I play a <strong>lot</strong> of video games I still really do love sports. When I was younger I played a lot of baseball and some times soccer. Eventually I grew out of baseball and started to play a lot more soccer, and I started playing soccer competetivly. My parents and I desided over the summer there isn't much soccer so I tried this sport called water polo. I have never even heard of this sport before. But I felt it would be a good sport for me since when I was 8 I was in the YMCA swim team. I later relised I loved this sport. It was a fun concept, and it was easier for me to breathe.</p>

		<h2>Asthma</h2>

		<p>I relised I found out I had <a href="https://www.webmd.com/asthma/default.htm">asthma</a> right before the time I got hsp. Asthma was pretty hard for me because I loved sports, in sports it was hard to breathe some times. I went to the docter a lot. I would get more inhailers. I would use these everytime before I played sports, and they really helped. Im twelve now and ive had asthma for about 4 years now and i've learned you can overcome it. You just always need to breathe for anything, even if you dont think you need to. I also learned you always need to take deep breathes and when ever you aree running out of breath don't get nervous just keep calm.</p>
